PHP for Website's

Master branch of my PHP Repo, this repo consist of easy to use and free to use PHP scripts.

At the moment navigation and mail scripts are availeble, more to come.

In the navigation branch you will find PHP Scripts for navigating website's using the switch() function

In the mail branch you will find scripts for mailing using the mail() function and pre-set smtp servers, with or without ssl.

Feel free to add more usefull scripts, though keep this repo as clean as possible.
